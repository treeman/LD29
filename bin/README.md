How nice of you to check out my game! This is my attempt for Ludum Dare 29 themed "Beneath the Surface".

Unfortunately I took on too much and I couldn't quite get things finished.

Here's what works:

* You can drag rooms and the worker will build them
* You can place objects
* Placing a bed means you can hire a new worker
* If you build on mineral ores, you will get money

Here's what does not:

* No sound!
* Multiple levels with more ores in lower ones
* Any kind of worker stats and cost for them
* Any kind of balancing
* Objects actually interacting with the workers
* Any kind of fun!

Still, I had a blast during this Ludum Dare!! I might make this a personal project and finish it later.

If you still want a go, here's how to play:

Choose a room, drag to build things. You must build where the worker starts. If you want more workers you need to build more beds. They can be placed anywhere. To gain money you must build or mine on an ore patch.

If I work on expanding the game I will write about it here: <http://www.jonashietala.se>
