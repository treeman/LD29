This is an unfinished [game](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=1895) for [Ludum Dare 29](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) with the theme "Beneath the Surface".

If you want to compile it you'll need SFML 2.1 and it uses certain C++11 features. A reasonably new version of gcc should be needed, I used gcc version 4.7.1.
